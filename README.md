# I'm gViewer

This is a image viewer intend to help graphics programmers debug output images. Inspired by [WinPIX](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pix/download/) and [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/). I don't want to run big tools every time when I just want to look into some images. So I make this tool. Currently using it for my toy offline ray tracer.
